## 09.03.2024
- **Explored Concepts:**
  - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Understanding the framework and its applications.
  - **LangChain:** Introduction to the library and its role in RAG systems.
  - **Multi-Agent System:** Exploration of how multiple agents can be used to enhance the performance of language models.

## 09.10.2024
- **Progress Made:**
  - Created a **general diagram** to outline the project workflow and architecture.
  - Identified a suitable **dataset** for the project.
  - Built a **simple RAG pipeline** using basic components.
  - Experimented with different **models for embeddings** and evaluated their effectiveness.
  - Integrated an initial version of a **Language Model (LLM)** into the pipeline.

## 09.17.2024
- **Next Steps:**
  - Conduct a literature review to **find relevant research** related to RAG and multi-agent systems.
  - Develop a **modular code structure** to facilitate scalability and testing.
  - Write and run **test scripts** to ensure code functionality.
  - Begin the process of **data acquisition** and cleaning.
  - Continue exploration and testing of the **data** from various sources.
