    "Is Hirschsprung disease a Mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?": "According to the provided context, Hirschsprung disease has a complex genetic etiology with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms. These genes encode for receptors, ligands, transcriptional factors, or other cell elements that are usually involved in the RET and EDNRB signaling transduction pathways.\n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that Hirschsprung disease is a multifactorial disorder, as it involves the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors, rather than a single gene mutation following a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern. The complex interplay between multiple genes and genetic variations contributes to the development of the disease, making it a multifactorial disorder.",
    "List signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR?": "According to the context, the 7 known EGFR ligands are:\n\n1. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)\n2. Betacellulin (BTC)\n3. Epiregulin (EPR)\n4. Heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF)\n5. Transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1)\n6. Amphiregulin (AREG)\n7. Epigen (EPG)",
    "Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?": "According to the research article \"Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional in the human genome but inefficient for lncRNAs\", the answer is that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are not spliced as efficiently as protein-coding genes. The study found that splicing occurs predominantly during transcription in the human genome, but it is inefficient for lncRNAs.",
    "Is RANKL secreted from the cells?": "Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that RANKL (Receptor Activator of NF-\u03baB Ligand) is secreted from cells. In the text, it is mentioned that adipocyte-secreted cytokines upregulated RANKL mRNA expression in osteoblasts, suggesting that RANKL is produced and secreted by adipocytes. Additionally, the text states that OPG (Osteoprotegerin) is a decoy receptor that binds to RANKL, implying that RANKL is secreted by cells and can interact with OPG.",
    "Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?": "According to the provided context, the following miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer:\n\n1. miR-200a\n2. miR-100\n3. miR-141\n4. miR-200b\n5. miR-200c\n6. miR-203\n7. miR-510\n8. miR-509-5p\n9. miR-132\n10. miR-26a\n11. let-7b\n12. miR-145\n13. miR-182\n14. miR-152\n15. miR-148a\n16. let-7a\n17. let-7i\n18. miR-21\n19. miR-92\n20. miR-93\n\nThese miRNAs could potentially be used as biomarkers for the detection and diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.",
    "Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?": "According to the context, Pyridostigmine and Neostigmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are used as first-line therapy for the symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis.",
    "Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?": "Based on the provided context, there is no mention of Denosumab (Prolia) or its FDA approval status. The discussion focuses on trastuzumab, cabazitaxel, and hormonal therapy for prostate cancer, but Denosumab is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context whether Denosumab has been approved by the FDA.",
    "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?": "The context does not mention the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor. It discusses the effects of EGFR ligands on K5+K19- hMEC differentiation, specifically the comparison of AREG and TGF \u03b1 on cell differentiation. Therefore, I cannot answer the question about the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor as it is not relevant to the provided context.",
    "Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?": "According to the context, Orteronel was developed for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.",
    "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?": "According to the context, the use of Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the HER2 receptor, has been investigated in prostate cancer. Although clinical trials have failed to demonstrate its efficacy in unselected patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, the study reports that combination therapy with docetaxel improves the response of prostate cancer xenografts. Therefore, the answer to the question is that Trastuzumab (Herceptin) may have potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in combination with other therapies.",
    "Which are the Yamanaka factors?": "According to the text, the Yamanaka factors are:\n\n1. Oct4\n2. Sox2\n3. Klf4\n4. c-Myc",
    "Where is the protein Pannexin1 located?": "Based on the provided context, I couldn't find a specific mention of Pannexin1. However, I can provide general information about Pannexin1.\n\nPannexin1 is a protein that is primarily found on the surface of cells, particularly in the plasma membrane. It is a type of gap junction protein that forms channels allowing for the direct exchange of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules between adjacent cells. Pannexin1 has been found to be expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, and skin, among others.\n\nIf you're looking for more specific information or a reference to a particular study or publication, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!",
    "Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?": "According to the provided context, the currently known mitochondrial diseases that have been attributed to POLG mutations are:\n\n1. Recessive PEO (Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia)\n2. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE)\n\nNote that the text also mentions that POLG mutations can cause multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and axonal sensory neuropathy, but these are not separate diseases."
