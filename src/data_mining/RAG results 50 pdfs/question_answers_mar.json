    "Is Hirschsprung disease a Mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?": "According to the text, Hirschsprung disease has a complex genetic etiology, with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms. These genes encode for receptors, ligands, transcriptional factors, or other cell elements that are usually involved in the RET and EDNRB signaling transduction pathways.\n\nThis suggests that Hirschsprung disease is likely a multifactorial disorder, rather than a Mendelian disorder. Mendelian disorders are typically caused by mutations in a single gene, whereas multifactorial disorders are caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\nIn fact, the text mentions that Hirschsprung disease has a complex genetic etiology, implying that it is a multifactorial disorder. Additionally, the references cited in the text, such as Emison et al. (2005) and Borrego et al. (2008), also suggest that Hirschsprung disease is a multifactorial disorder.",
    "List signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR?": "According to the context, the signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR are:\n\n1. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)\n2. Betacellulin (BTC)\n3. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)\n4. Amphiregulin (AR)\n5. Epiregulin (EPR)\n6. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1)\n7. Epigen (EPG)",
    "Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?": "Based on the context, it seems that the question is related to the topic of RNA processing and regulation in cancer. According to current knowledge, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can undergo various types of RNA processing, including splicing.\n\nYes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be spliced, just like messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In fact, many lncRNAs have been shown to undergo alternative splicing, which can result in the production of multiple isoforms with different functions. This dynamic regulation of lncRNA splicing can play a crucial role in various biological processes, including cancer development and progression.\n\nFor example, a study published in Clinical Cancer Research in 2004 found that the Her-2/neu gene, which is often overexpressed in prostate cancer, can undergo dynamic regulation through alternative splicing. This study suggests that the Her-2/neu gene can produce multiple isoforms with different functions, which can contribute to the development and progression of prostate cancer.\n\nIn summary, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can undergo splicing, which is an important mechanism for regulating their function and expression in various biological processes, including cancer",
    "Is RANKL secreted from the cells?": "According to the provided context, RANKL (Receptor Activator of NF-\u03baB Ligand) expression increased in osteoblasts stimulated with adipocyte-secreted factors, as reported by Goto et al (20). This suggests that RANKL is secreted from osteoblasts, rather than being intracellularly expressed.",
    "Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?": "According to the article \"MicroRNA Microarray Identifies Let-7ias a Novel Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Human Epithelial Ovarian Cancer\" and the review \"Candidate microRNA biomarkers in human epithelial ovarian cancer: systematic review profiling studies and experimental validation\", Let-7i has been identified as a potential biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer. Additionally, the review mentions that miR-519a, 153, and 485-5p have been deregulated in ovarian epithelial tumors and may also be potential biomarkers.",
    "Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?": "According to the provided context, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are mentioned as a treatment option for myasthenia gravis. However, the specific acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used for treatment are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?": "No, Denosumab (Prolia) is not mentioned in the provided context, and therefore, it is not approved by the FDA according to the text. The context only mentions FDA approvals for sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, and trastuzumab.",
    "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?": "According to the given context, the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor mentioned are:\n\n1. NOTCH1\n2. NOTCH3\n3. NOTCH4",
    "Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?": "The passage does not mention Orteronel, so it is not possible to determine which cancer it was developed for based on this context.",
    "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?": "According to the context, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been investigated for its potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Although clinical trials have shown limited efficacy in unselected patients, there is still a need to explore its potential use in combination with other therapies, such as docetaxel, in patients with HER2-overexpressing prostate cancer.",
    "Which are the Yamanaka factors?": "According to the provided context, the Yamanaka factors are:\n\n1. Oct4\n2. Sox2\n3. Klf4\n4. c-Myc",
    "Where is the protein Pannexin1 located?": "Based on my training data, I found that Pannexin1 is a protein that is primarily located on the surface of cells, particularly on the plasma membrane. It is also known to be expressed in various tissues and organs, including the brain, heart, and skin.",
    "Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?": "According to the provided context, recessive PEO patients with POLG mutations are known to have a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, which may include PEO and axonal sensory neuropathy. Additionally, multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and can be caused by missense mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma."
