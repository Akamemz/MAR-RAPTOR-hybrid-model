    "Is Hirschsprung disease a Mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?": "Based on the provided context, Hirschsprung disease has a complex genetic etiology with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms. This suggests that Hirschsprung disease is a multifactorial disorder, as it is influenced by the interactions of multiple genetic and environmental factors.",
    "List signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR?": "Based on the context, the signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR are:\n\n1. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)\n2. Betacellulin (BTC)\n3. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)\n4. Amphiregulin (AR)\n5. Epiregulin (EPR)\n6. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1)\n7. Epigen (EPG)\n\nThese ligands are capable of binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR, leading to receptor activation and subsequent signaling pathways.",
    "Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?": "According to the research article \"Research: Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional in the human genome but inefficient for lncRNAs\" by Hagen Tilgner et al. (2013), the study found that splicing occurs predominantly during transcription in the human genome, but inefficiently for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This suggests that lncRNAs may not undergo splicing as efficiently as other types of RNAs.",
    "Is RANKL secreted from the cells?": "No, the text does not mention RANKL (Receptor Activator of NF-\u03baB Ligand). It discusses OPG (Osteoprotegerin), which is secreted by endothelial cells and has various functions, including promoting angiogenesis, cell migration, and proliferation, as well as acting as a decoy receptor for TRAIL. RANKL is not mentioned in the provided context.",
    "Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?": "According to the context, Let-7i has been identified as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in human epithelial ovarian cancer. Additionally, the systematic review mentions that miR-519a, 153, and 485-5p have been found to be deregulated in ovarian epithelial tumors and may have clinicopathological relevance. Therefore, these miRNAs could be potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer.",
    "Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?": "According to the provided context, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are mentioned as one of the symptomatic treatment options for myasthenia gravis. However, the specific acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the most commonly used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of myasthenia gravis are pyridostigmine (Mestinon) and neostigmine (Prostigmin). These medications work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is essential for muscle contraction, thereby increasing the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction and improving muscle strength.",
    "Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?": "Based on the provided context, there is no mention of Denosumab (Prolia) or its FDA approval status. The context discusses various cancer treatments, including sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, and hormonal therapy, but does not mention Denosumab.",
    "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?": "There is no information provided in the context about the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor. The context discusses the effects of various EGFR ligands on K5+K19- hMEC differentiation, specifically focusing on AREG and TGF \u03b1.",
    "Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?": "Orteronel is not mentioned in the provided context, so it is not possible to determine which cancer it was developed for. However, the context discusses prostate cancer and the development of novel therapies for hormone-refractory prostate cancer, but Orteronel is not specifically mentioned.",
    "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?": "According to the provided context, the answer is yes, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is being investigated for its potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The study mentioned in the text reports the improvement of docetaxel response in prostate cancer xenografts when combined with trastuzumab. Additionally, previous clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab in prostate cancer, although these trials did not demonstrate its effectiveness. Nevertheless, the idea of combining trastuzumab with other agents, such as paclitaxel or lapatinib, is still being explored.",
    "Which are the Yamanaka factors?": "According to the text, the Yamanaka factors are:\n\n1. Oct4\n2. Sox2\n3. Klf4\n4. c-Myc",
    "Where is the protein Pannexin1 located?": "According to the related content, Pannexin1 is located on the plasma membrane.",
    "Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?": "According to the provided context, recessive PEO patients with POLG mutations have been previously described, and the clinical phenotype of these patients is heterogeneous. Common features include PEO and axonal sensory neuropathy, but associated multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions can be caused by missense mutations in POLG."
