    "Is Hirschsprung disease a Mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?": "According to the provided context, Hirschsprung disease has a complex genetic etiology, with several genes being described as associated with either isolated or syndromic forms. These genes encode for receptors, ligands, transcriptional factors, or other cell elements that are usually involved in the RET and EDNRB signaling transduction pathways. This suggests that Hirschsprung disease is a multifactorial disorder, rather than a simple Mendelian disorder, as it involves the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors.",
    "List signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR?": "According to the provided context, the signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR are:\n\n1. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)\n2. Betacellulin (BTC)\n3. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)\n4. Amphiregulin (AR)\n5. Epiregulin (EPR)\n6. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1)\n7. Epigen (EPG)\n\nThese ligands are capable of binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR and inducing various biological responses.",
    "Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?": "According to the research article, splicing of lncRNAs is inefficient. The article states: \"splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional in the human genome but inefficient for lncRNAs.\" This suggests that lncRNAs do not undergo efficient splicing, unlike other types of RNA.",
    "Is RANKL secreted from the cells?": "Based on the provided context, RANKL (Receptor Activator of NF-\u03baB Ligand) expression is mentioned as increasing in osteoblasts stimulated with adipocyte-secreted factors (Goto et al, 2000) and in osteoblasts in the bone microenvironment (this study). However, it is not explicitly stated that RANKL is secreted from the cells.\n\nThe text only mentions the purification of secreted antibody from culture medium using affinity chromatography on a protein G Sepharose, but it does not mention the secretion of RANKL. RANKL expression is mentioned as increasing in response to adipocyte-secreted factors, but it does not specify whether RANKL is secreted from the cells or not.",
    "Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?": "According to the provided context, specifically the article \"MicroRNA Microarray Identifies Let-7ias a Novel Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Human Epithelial Ovarian Cancer\" and the systematic review \"Candidate microRNA biomarkers in human epithelial ovarian cancer: systematic review profiling studies and experimental validation\", Let-7i has been identified as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in human epithelial ovarian cancer.\n\nAdditionally, the systematic review mentions that miR-519a, 153, and 485-5p have been deregulated in ovarian epithelial tumors and may be used as potential biomarkers.\n\nIt is worth noting that the article and review highlight the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in ovarian cancer carcinogenesis and progression, and suggest that miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.",
    "Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?": "According to the provided context, the symptomatic treatment options for myasthenia gravis include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, the specific acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used for treatment are not mentioned in the given text. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, the commonly used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for myasthenia gravis treatment are pyridostigmine (Mestinon), neostigmine (Prostigmin), and rivastigmine (Exelon).",
    "Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?": "No, Denosumab (Prolia) is not mentioned in the provided context. The context only discusses sipuleucel-T (Provenge), cabazitaxel, and trastuzumab, but not Denosumab (Prolia).",
    "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?": "According to the provided context, the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor are:\n\n1. NOTCH1\n2. NOTCH3\n3. NOTCH4\n\nThese isoforms of the Notch receptor are expressed in blood vessels and smooth muscle cells, and they all have ectodomains composed of a large number of EGF-like domain repeats.",
    "Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?": "Orteronel is not mentioned in the provided context. The context only discusses treatment options for advanced prostate cancer, including systemic chemotherapy, docetaxel, mitoxantrone, trastuzumab, and 212Pb-trastuzumab. Orteronel is not a treatment option mentioned in the provided texts.",
    "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?": "According to the context, the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been investigated for its potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Although clinical trials have failed to demonstrate its efficacy, a recent phase II clinical trial of trastuzumab and docetaxel in HER2-overexpressing prostate cancer has been conducted, and the study reported here shows that combination with trastuzumab improves the response of prostate cancer xenografts to docetaxel. Therefore, the answer is yes, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in combination with other therapies.",
    "Which are the Yamanaka factors?": "The Yamanaka factors mentioned in the text are:\n\n1. Oct4\n2. Sox2\n3. Klf4\n4. c-Myc",
    "Where is the protein Pannexin1 located?": "The text does not explicitly state the location of Pannexin1 (Panx1). However, it does contrast the location of Panx2 with the location of Panx1. It mentions that Panx2 has an intracellular localization, but it does not provide information on the location of Panx1.",
    "Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?": "According to the context, recessive PEO patients with POLG mutations have been reported, and the clinical phenotype is quite heterogeneous. Common features include PEO and axonal sensory neuropathy, but associated multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions."
