EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor): A 53-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR with high affinity, stimulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.\n2. TGF-\u03b1 (Transforming Growth Factor-alpha): A 50-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR with high affinity, involved in cell growth, differentiation, and migration.\n3. Amphiregulin (AR): A 79-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR and stimulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.\n4. Epiregulin (EPR): A 79-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR and stimulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.\n5. HB-EGF (Heparin-Binding EGF-like Growth Factor): A 105-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR and is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival.\n6. Betacellulin (BTC): A 79-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR and stimulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.\n7. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1): A 258-amino acid protein that binds to EGFR and is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival.\n\nThese ligands are recognized as EGFR ligands and interact with the receptor to stimulate various cellular processes.",
    "Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?": "Based on the provided context, I will provide the passages for analysis. Please review the following passages and answer the question:\n\nPassage 1: \nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules that are longer than 200 nucleotides and do not code for proteins. They are often transcribed from genomic regions that are not coding for proteins, such as intergenic regions or introns. \n\nPassage 2:\nSome lncRNAs can undergo splicing, which involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons. This process is similar to the splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) and can result in the creation of a variety of isoforms.\n\nPassage 3: \nHowever, not all lncRNAs undergo splicing. Some lncRNAs are produced as a single continuous transcript, without the removal of introns. These lncRNAs are often referred to as \"non-spliced\" or \"unspliced\".\n\nPlease analyze the passages, identify the key information, remove redundant details, and organize the information logically to provide a clear and concise answer to the question: \"Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?\"",
    "Is RANKL secreted from the cells?": "I'm excited to help you with that!\n\nUnfortunately, the provided context doesn't contain any relevant information about RANKL or its secretion from cells. Therefore, I must acknowledge the limitations and indicate that I cannot provide a comprehensive answer based on the given context.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer to the question, more information is needed about RANKL and its cellular secretion. If you could provide additional context or relevant passages, I'd be happy to help you analyze and combine the relevant information to answer the question.",
    "Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?": "Based on the combined context, the following miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer:\n\n1. miR-21: Elevated levels of miR-21 have been associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression, making it a potential biomarker for early detection and monitoring of EOC.\n2. miR-155: High levels of miR-155 have been correlated with increased tumor size and advanced stage of EOC, making it a potential biomarker for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment.\n3. miR-199b: Low levels of miR-199b have been associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival rate in EOC patients, making it a potential biomarker for predicting patient outcome.\n4. miR-214: Low levels of miR-214 have been correlated with increased tumor proliferation and reduced apoptosis, making it a potential biomarker for detecting early-stage EOC and monitoring treatment response.\n\nThese miRNAs have significant expression changes and associations with clinical outcomes, making them potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer.\n\nNote: The combined context provides a comprehensive overview of the potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer, and the answer is based on the relevant information provided in the passages.",
    "Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?": "Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is:\n\nPyridostigmine and neostigmine are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.\n\nThe relevant information from the context is that Passage 1 states that pyridostigmine and neostigmine are commonly used to treat myasthenia gravis, and Passage 3 explains that the primary goal of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis is to increase the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction. This information indicates that pyridostigmine and neostigmine are the specific acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used to treat myasthenia gravis.\n\nNote that Passage 2 mentions rivastigmine and donepezil as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer's disease, but this information is not relevant to the question about the treatment of myasthenia gravis.",

    "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?": "Based on the given context, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is not of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer. The monoclonal antibody is primarily used to target HER2-positive breast cancer, and there is no established role for it in the treatment of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is a hormone-dependent disease, and its progression is influenced by androgens, whereas HER2 is not typically associated with prostate cancer. Therefore, Trastuzumab is not a relevant treatment option for prostate cancer.\n\nThe key information provided in the context highlights that Trastuzumab targets HER2 and is primarily used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer. Prostate cancer is a hormone-dependent disease, and its progression is influenced by androgens. Moreover, HER2 is not typically associated with prostate cancer, and there is no established role for Trastuzumab in the treatment of this disease.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided context, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is not of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer.",
