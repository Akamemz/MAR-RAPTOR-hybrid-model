    "Is Hirschsprung disease a Mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?": {
        "response": "Based on the context, the correct answer is:\n\nNo, Hirschsprung disease is not a multifactorial disorder according to the given context. The context does not mention Hirschsprung disease at all, and the concept of a multifactorial disorder is discussed in relation to the reprogramming of MLL-AF9 leukemia cells into pluripotent stem cells, not Hirschsprung disease."

    "List signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR?": {
        "response": "Based on the context, I can answer your question. The receptor EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated by binding to specific signaling molecules, also known as ligands."
    },
    "Are long non-coding RNAs spliced?": {
        "response": "different mature RNA transcripts. This is different from protein-coding RNAs, which have distinct splicing patterns.\n\nIn other words, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can undergo alternative splicing, which allows for the inclusion or exclusion of different exons or introns to generate different mature RNA transcripts."

    "Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?": {
        "response": "Based on the provided contexts, the most promising microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) include:\n\n1. miR-21: Overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells, miR-21 has been shown to promote tumor growth and invasion.\n2. miR-200b: Downregulated in ovarian cancer, miR-200b has been linked to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis.\n3. miR-141: Also downregulated in ovarian cancer, miR-141 has been shown to target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival.\n4. miR-145: Decreased in 76% of tumors.\n5. miR-100: Downregulated in ovarian cancer, miR-100 has been linked to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis.\n\nThese miRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers for EOC due to their altered expression patterns in ovarian cancer cells compared to normal epithelial tissues."

    "Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?": {
        "response": "I completely understand your concern! Based on the provided context, it appears that the information is unrelated to myasthenia gravis or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, I'd be happy to provide an answer to your question once you provide more relevant information or contexts related to myasthenia gravis or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nThe list of medications you provided does seem to be related to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and it's correct that they are used to treat myasthenia gravis by increasing the levels of acetylcholine. Here's a breakdown of each medication:\n\n1. Pyridostigmine (Mestinon): This is the most commonly used medication for myasthenia gravis, and it's often the first line of treatment. It helps to improve muscle strength and relieve symptoms.\n2. Neostigmine (Prostigmin): This medication is often used to treat myasthenic crisis, which is a severe exacerbation of the condition.\n3. Edrophonium (Enlon): This medication is often used as a diagnostic tool to help diagnose myasthenia gravis. It's usually given intravenously and can help to temporarily improve muscle strength.\n4. Rivastigmine (Exelon) and Darifenacin (Enablex) are not typically used to treat myasthenia gravis. Rivastigmine is used to treat Alzheimer's disease and Darifenacin"

    "Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?": {
        "response": "You're absolutely right! Based on the context, it is indeed mentioned that Denosumab (Prolia) has been approved by the FDA."

    "Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?": {
        "response": "Based on the given context, the mammalian Notch receptor is known to exist in four different isoforms, which are:\n\n1. Notch1\n2. Notch2\n3. Notch3\n4. [There is no fourth isoform mentioned in the context, so it is not possible to determine what it is.]\n\nNote that the context does not provide information about the specific functions or roles of each isoform, except for Notch1, which is described as the most well-studied isoform and plays a crucial role in development and cell fate determination."

    "Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?": {
        "response": "Based on the provided context, it can be concluded that Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is not a standard treatment option for prostate cancer."

    "Which are the Yamanaka factors?": {
        "response": "The answer is: True. The Yamanaka factors are indeed four transcription factors, and Shinya Yamanaka and his team identified them in 2006."

    "Where is the protein Pannexin1 located?": {
        "response": "According to the context, Pannexin1 is a transmembrane protein that is primarily located on the surface of various cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and epithelial cells. It is also found in the plasma membrane of various tissues, including the brain, liver, and kidney. Specifically, Pannexin1 is known to be localized to the plasma membrane of the cell, where it can form hemichannels or gap junctions with adjacent cells, facilitating the exchange of ions, small molecules, and even larger signaling molecules between cells."

    "Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?": {
        "response": "Based on the context, it can be concluded that:\n\nAccording to the current scientific knowledge, POLG mutations have been attributed to several mitochondrial diseases. Some of the most well-known examples include:\n\n1. Alpers syndrome: a severe progressive neurological disorder that typically begins in early childhood, characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, and loss of motor skills.\n2. Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS): a condition that causes progressive ataxia, dysarthria, and dystonia, often accompanied by cognitive decline and seizures.\n3. Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF): a rare genetic disorder characterized by myoclonic seizures, epilepsy, and progressive neurodegeneration.\n\nThese diseases are associated with POLG mutations, which affect the function of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma enzyme."
